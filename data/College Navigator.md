**NET PRICE

Full-time beginning undergraduate students who were awarded grant or scholarship aid from federal, state or local governments, or the
institution.

Average net price $15,234 $11,935 $12,
**Full-time beginning undergraduate students who were awarded Title IV aid by income.
AVERAGE NET PRICE BY
INCOME 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-**
$0 – $30,000 $11,657 $9,155 $9,
$30,001 – $48,000 $11,694 $8,449 $10,
$48,001 – $75,000 $13,925 $10,923 $11,
$75,001 – $110,000 $17,388 $15,139 $15,
$110,001 and more $18,956 $14,969 $16,
Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state/local government, or institutional grant or scholarship aid
from the total cost of attendance. Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies, and the
weighted average for room and board and other expenses.
Beginning students are those who are entering postsecondary education for the first time.
Title IV aid to students includes grant aid, work study aid, and loan aid. These include: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG), National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant
(National SMART Grant), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Federal Work-Study, Federal
Perkins Loan, Subsidized Direct or FFEL Stafford Loan, and Unsubsidized Direct or FFEL Stafford Loan. For those Title IV recipients, net price
is reported by income category and includes students awarded federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While
Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of
attendance minus grant aid.
**NET PRICE CALCULATOR**
An institution’s net price calculator allows current and prospective students, families, and other consumers to estimate the net price of attending
that institution for a particular student.

RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES
FIRST-TO-SECOND YEAR RETENTION RATES
Retention rates measure the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor's degrees who return to the institution to continue their
studies the following fall.
RETENTION RATES FOR FIRST-TIME STUDENTS PURSUING BACHELOR'S DEGREES
```
```
Percentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2021 and Returned in Fall 2022
OVERALL GRADUATION RATE AND TRANSFER-OUT RATE
The overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began
their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a
certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled.
Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution
without completing at the current institution.
Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or
who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 58 percent of entering students were counted as
"full-time, first-time" in 2022.

Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their

BACHELOR'S DEGREE GRADUATION RATES
Bachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a
bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time.

```
OUTCOME MEASURES
Alternative measures of student success are reported by degree-granting institutions to describe the outcomes of degree/certificate-seeking
undergraduate students who are not only first-time, full-time students, but also part-time attending and non-first-time (transfer-in) students.
These measures are also reported for students receiving Pell grants and those students that do not receive Pell grants. These measures
provide the 8-year award-completion rates by award level (certificates, associate's and bachelor degrees) after entering an institution. For
students who did not earn any undergraduate award after 8-years of entry, the enrollment statuses are reported as either still enrolled at the
institution, or subsequently transferred out of the institution. Unlike the Graduation Rates data, all reporting institutions must report on their
transfer outs regardless if the institution has a mission that provides substantial transfer preparation.
